//! `StorageBackend` is the per drive contract.
//!
//! One instance represents one drive. The trait covers volume lifecycle,
//! streaming byte reads and writes at a path within a volume, and
//! xl.meta-aware operations that read and write `FileInfo` records for
//! object versions. Higher layers hold one instance for single-drive
//! setups or several for erasure-coded sets.
//!
//! Data-path methods (`read_file_stream`, `create_file_stream`) take or
//! return a `ByteStream` so bytes flow through one stripe at a time;
//! the trait deliberately has no whole-buffer read/write surface — the
//! engine is forbidden from materialising an object end-to-end.
