Overview
========

This document proposes the initial documentation hierarchy for OpenLake.

The goal is to provide a structured learning path for both developers and users,
covering development workflows, deployment, operations, and system architecture.

.. note::

   This document describes the proposed documentation organization.
   Individual pages will be implemented incrementally.
